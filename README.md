# EEP153-Project-2-Casimir-Funk
## Topic & Goals

Our project focused on analyzing varying hot topic diets such as raw vegan, raw meat, and both in comparison to USDA recommended diet. We drew on inspiration from Liver King, Vegan teacher, and butter guy all on TikTok. 

Our project goals included:

    [Goal 1] Develop code to find the minimum pricing for maximum nutrition content for all three diets 

    [Goal 2] Assess feasibility, health and pricing of all three diets in Berkeley, California
    
    [Goal 3] Create recipes that fulfill the minimum nutrient requirements for each diet and compare their pricing

    [Goal 4] Decide what is the best diet for a Berkeley student


Area of interest: 

We will be looking at these price minimums in Berkeley, California.

In 2021, the city of Berkeley passed a resolution to reduce the amount of animal products the city purchases by 50% by 2024 making the traditional supply and demand relationships change.

Questions of Interest:

- Population pyramid on select countries

- Animated population pyramid on select regions/countries for comparison 

- Import/export plot on select countries

- GDP per capita plot on select countries

- Continent Map: Population Density & GDP Per Capita



DataSet of interest:

- 5: Subnational Malnutrition Database


- 11: Africa Development Indicators


- 16: Health Nutrition and Population Statistics


- 40: Population estimates and projections
